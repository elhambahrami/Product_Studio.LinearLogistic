Targeting right customer for the right offer is very important for credit companies as they have different type of offers which is related to money so as we receive different offers every month from different credit companies but one of the most attractive credit offers is cash advance and it rise another question how much cash advace needs to be offered to which customer and how the companies decide?
Now I am going to use Linear Logistic to predict cash advance offer to the customers based on the spending behavior. Let's look into our dataset:
The data that is going to be used for this analysis; CC GENERAL.csv, which is taken from Kaggle and included  credit card holders' informations.
The analysis is planning to be delivered in jupyter notebook with cods and plots and at the end I will get to a conclusion.
